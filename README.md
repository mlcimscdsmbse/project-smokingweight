# Smoking and weight gain project

### Machine Learning and Causal Inference. MSc in Data Science Methodology. Barcelona School of Economics.

Project idea borrowed from the book by Hernan and Robins (2021).

## Description

In this project you should attempt to conduct a causal analysis of
data collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Data I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). A detailed description
of the NHEFS data can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs

These data is used throughout the book of Hernan and Robins (2021)
and there you will find comprehensive explanations about these data, as well
as ideas to analyse it from a causal perspective. One of the possible
causal questions to answer is to estimate the causal effect of smoking
cessation on weight gain.

## Submission procedure

This project has to be submitted using
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). This
means that you should have cloned the GitHub repo of this project
from the organization account for MLCI in the corresponding academic
year at https://github.com/mlciXXXX using the submission link
provided at the Google Classroom.

Once you have cloned this GitHub repo, then you can work on it in
your local disk and _push_ your changes whenever you like, but make
sure that you have pushed the last version of your assignment before
the deadline; consult the Google Classroom if you are unsure about
the deadline. There is no _submit_ button or any other specific
submission procedure or action than just pushing your changes to your
GitHub assignment repo. When correcting the assignment, the version
available at the deadline will be retrieved. If the last update to
the repo is posterior to the deadline, then the mark of the
assignment will have a penalty.
